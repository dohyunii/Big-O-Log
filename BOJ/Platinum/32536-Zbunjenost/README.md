## [[BOJ-32536] Zbunjenost](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/32536)

> **Topic:** Dynamic Programming, Mathematics, Graph Theory, Tree, Combinatorics, Planar Graph\
> **Difficulty:** Platinum 1

### Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** $O(N\log(N))$
* **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$

### Mistakes & Lessons
**Learned:** Learned about dual graph. If you have a triangulation of a polygon, the dual graph is always a tree. In dual graph, cycle becomes cut, max flow <-> shortest path.
